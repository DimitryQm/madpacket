# madpacket
madpacket is a single-header C++20 library for defining binary protocols/register blocks/file formats as compile-time layouts and reading/writing fields directly in raw buffers with predictable bit packing, explicit endianness, and configurable MMIO width/alignment semantics, safer than struct overlays and faster than runtime serializers.
